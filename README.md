### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

Iâ€™m Gareth, a passionate designer / developer for the web and iOS. I have over 15 years of professional experience in architecting, designing, and building digital products. I find beauty in simplicity, aiming for elegance and sophistication in every project that I'm involved with.

While no longer my full-time profession, I still love developing. My iOS app, [Fight Scores](https://fightscores.co), has amassed a loyal group of users and an average app store rating of over 4.5. Recently it hit the milestone of 35,000 scorecards added.

I'm also working on a user feedback tool called [Speedback](https://speedback.co), it's not yet launched but you can follow along with the progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/@garethdafyddjones).

I love to write Swift, Ruby on Rails, and React. When I get time I enjoy dabbling with Elixir and Phoenix.

Originally hailing from South Wales, Iâ€™m currently living in Charlotte, North Carolina, after enjoying spells working in Canada, India, Italy, and France.
I love to get outdoors, running and hiking in the mountains. When not spending time with my beautiful wife and daughter, I can be found indulging my passions for wine and boxing.

Hwyl fawr,
Gareth
